# hash_verifier

To use the program, you can run it from the command line like this:

python hash_checker.py <hash> <filename>

The program will compare the supplied hash with the hash derived from the file using each of the supported algorithms, and it will output the name of the file, whether the checksum is valid or not, the algorithm used, and the checksum provided and calculated.
